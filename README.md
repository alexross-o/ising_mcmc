# Ising Model Markov Chain Monte Carlo
It works, but has not been tested throughly. Use for your own benefit (or peril).
Uses partial randomisation of lattice spin flips; performance scales well with lattice size.
Also includes helper functions for viewing/animating simulation results.

Currently written in Python, a Rust implementation is on the way...
